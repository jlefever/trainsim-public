### Group Homework Assignment 2: Train Ticket System in Microservice Architecture

The objective of this project is to understand and practice microservice architecture concepts.

The user scenarios (requirements) are the same as Group Homework Assignment 1 (GHA1). In this homework, you are supposed to refactor the trains-ticket system in GHA1 into a microservice architecture:

- The refactored project should have at least three separated repositories.
- The user should be able to use the system in the same way as in GHA1.

**Submission Guidelines:**

We will grade based on your project repository, which should have the following:

1. Implemented artifacts:
  1. The new project should have the same functions as your GHA1.
  2. Each repository should implement one primary function.
  3. A readme file should be provided indicating how to use these repositories.
2. The design documents, including:
  1. Component diagram for the overall system
  2. Sequence diagrams for each implemented user scenario
  3. Quality attribute utility tree
  4. Tactics (will be) applied for the quality attributes specified in the utility tree

\*All the diagrams have to be generated from a computer program.
